# CrblBrushless

some piece of code to drive motors in conjunction with https://github.com/CrabTerlDc/CrabouillonPy

drive some ESP8266

drive some MKS-ESP32-FOC-V1.0 https://github.com/makerbase-motor/MKS-ESP32FOC/tree/MKS-ESP32-FOC-V1.0#

Barely fit my needs, provided as-is, no guaranties of any kind, at your own risks :)
